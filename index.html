He spent several years based at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva and was a member of the collaboration that discovered the Higgs boson. He played a major role in the development of the core software and algorithms for a real-time multi-stage cascade classifier that filters and reduces the collision event data rate from 60 TB/s to a manageable 300 MB/s that can be written to permanent storage for subsequent offline analysis. He now works on using machine learning techniques to develop classification algorithms for recognising particles based on their decay properties.

Although there is little systematic research to substantiate these claims, most data analysts will agree that getting data 'clean' for analyses is both essential and time-consuming.</p>

		      <p>In this 90 minute tutorial we develop a systematic view on data cleaning. Using the concept of a 'statistical value chain' as starting point, we will see that data cleaning has a natural place in a statistical analyses and that data cleaning can be thought of as a two-step process. In the first step one ensures the correct technical representation of a data set (variable type, text encoding, identifiability of a value, etc.). The second step is about ensuring that data meets expectations from domain knowledge (e.g. ages must be positive, an under-aged person cannot have an income from work, etc.).</p>

		      <p>In this tutorial we will demonstrate, using practical examples, several tools and R packages that can be used to solve both technical and content-related issues. Topics include but are not limited to string processing and approximate text matching, date/time conversion and knowledge-based data validation and correction. We also touch upon how to measure and visualize data quality and the effects of data cleaning on statistics.</p>

		      <p>The focus of this tutorial is scalable machine learning using the H2O R package. H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface.</p>

			<p>Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or ""Super Learners"", from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the h2oEnsemble R package.</p>

		      <h3>Package overview</h3>

		      <p>The data.table R package provides fast and memory efficient ways for data manipulation together with a flexible and consistent syntax. It was first released to CRAN in 2006. It has had over 30 releases since then with the current latest stable release being v1.9.6. Over 240 CRAN and Bioconductor packages now import/depend on data.table. Its StackOverflow tag has attracted >4000 questions from users in many fields making it a top 3 asked about R package. It is the 8th most starred R package on Github.</p>

															  <h3>Tutorial overview</h3>

															  <p>In this tutorial, we will learn data.table by doing, i.e., by looking at commonly occurring data manipulation questions (based on StackOverflow R tag) and using data.table's syntax and features to solve them. Depending on time availability, we might compare/contrast them to base R / other packages.</p>

															  <p>Briefly, we will look at problems that cover the following features:</p>

															  <ol>
															    <li>Getting data in and out - fread + rbindlist + fwrite.</li>
															    <li>Grouped aggregations and column addition/updates on subsets and joins.</li>

															    <li>Overview of equi-, non-equi, rolling and overlapping interval joins.</li>
															    <li>Reshaping.</li>
															  </ol>

															  <h3>Background knowledge</h3>

															  <p>Familiarity with base R is essential, and with SQL is advantageous but not essential. NOTE: It would be extremely advantageous for the participants to go through the "Introduction to data.table" vignette completely. The link to vignettes is provided at the bottom of this page.</p>
															  <h3>Requirements</h3>
															  <p>R (preferably latest version, for consistency) and latest CRAN version installed.</p>

	      <p>Shiny is a web application framework that makes it easy to build interactive web applications straight from R. A key feature of shiny is that users can create powerful apps driven by R without having to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript. However, incorporating these technologies into your apps can greatly enhance the power of shiny. In this workshop we’ll teach you how to create your own custom JavaScript bindings based on the htmlwidget package. The htmlwidgets package provides a framework for creating such bindings and allows you to bring the best of JavaScript into R. Even though using an htmlwidget is easy, constructing one may be challenging at first as you have to know a number of concepts in order to create a widget. These include things such as how to build an R package and how to use some basic JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This workshop is intended for the intermediate shiny enthusiast with limited experience in HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript, who wants to learn how to extend shiny. We’ll be creating a number of htmlwidgets based on C3.js, a popular JavaScript chart library, based on d3.js. In addition, we show various ways to extend Shiny by using JavaScript outside of the htmlwidgets framework.</>

No wonder that the really dedicated users -- independently from the exact domain they work in -- hardly ever need to switch to other environments while doing analytics-related tasks. The talk will cover my personal swiss army knife toolsets I use for infrastructure and business analytics. It will show:</p>

			<p>Working as a data scientist usually means working with data, building models, evaluating the results, translating them into actionable insights, getting feedback from experts and repeating the process.</p>
			<p>Hardly ever one starts with the model that finally will be used in production. It is usually trial and error process of trying new things and experimenting. That’s why data science project could get disorganized rapidly. Every test involves a new script, each script requires a multiple arguments and produces one or more data files. Keeping track of all this implied structure is a pain.</p>
			<p>The talk stresses the importance of having a process around data science related tasks, while keeping the main focus on creating a data product. We demonstrate the implementation of the light data science workflow - Dataflows.  Dataflows allows R users to create pipelines, without writing extra code, is self documenting and easy to start working with.</p>
			<p>During the talk we show the benefits of formalizing and structuring the process of model building in R. We mention the bottlenecks, propose solutions and biggest wins accomplished by introducing Dataflows. We strive to share our hands-on experience from various data science projects using R.</p>

		      <div class="session-abstract abstract"><p>In most situations a statistical analyst has no or only limited control over the process that generates the raw data to be analyzed. Testing assumptions about raw data, intermediate and final results is therefore an essential part of any statistical analyses. Often, such domain knowledge can be expressed in short statements such as 'age must be non-negative' or 'if two persons live at the same postal code, they live in the same city'.</p>
			<p>The 'validate' package makes it easy to formulate such assumptions, confront your data with these assumptions and subsequently to summarize or visualize the results in a transparent and reproducible way. In particular, 'validate' treats knowledge rules as first class citizens which means that they can be manipulated, documented, and stored and retrieved from file.</p>

		      <div class="session-abstract abstract">
			<p>The impact of relevant events on the stock market valuation of companies has been the subject of many studies. An event study is a statistical toolbox that allows to examine the impact of certain events on the firms' stock valuation. Given the rationality of market participants, the prices of securities immediately incorporate any relevant announcements, information, and updates.</p>
			<p>The idea of the event study is to compare the market valuation of the companies during periods related to an event and other (non-event linked) periods. If the behavior of stocks is significantly different in the event-period, then we conclude that an event produces an impact on the market valuation, otherwise we conclude that there is no effect.</p>
			<p>The major stream of research is focused on the insurance industry and catastrophe events, therefore, the cross-sectional dependence cannot be neglected. Furthermore, the returns typically are not normally distributed. These points lead to misspecification of the classical parametric tests, and require to validate the results by more tailored and accurate tests (both parametric and nonparametric).</p>
			<p>In order to incorporate all these issues we developed the package estudy2 (planned to be submitted to CRAN by August 2016). First, estudy2 incorporates all technical aspects of the rate of return calculation (the core computation is done in C++ by using Rcpp). Also the package incorporates 3 traditional market models: mean-adjusted returns, market-adjusted returns, single-index market model.</p>
			<p>Finally, 6 parametric and 6 nonparametric tests of daily cross-sectional abnormal return have been implemented. In addition, the package contains the tests for cumulative abnormal returns (CAR).</p>
			<p>In the proposed talk we demonstrate an example from current research, namely, the impact of major catastrophes on insurance firms' market valuation in order to validate the specification of the tests.</p>

		      <div class="session-abstract abstract">
			<p>Learning R is dangerous. It entices us in by presenting an incredibly powerful tool to solve our particular problem; for free! And as we learn how to do that, we uncover more things that make our solution even better. But then we start to look around our organisation or institution and see how it could make everyone's lives better too. And that's the dangerous part; R's got us hooked and we can't give up the belief that everyone else should be using this, right now. Even though R is free, open source software, there are often barriers to introducing it organisation-wide. This could be because of such things as IT or quality policies, the need for management buy-in or because of perceptions in learning the language. This presentation will first discuss the aspects required to understand these barriers to entry, and the different types of resolution for these. It will then use three projects to show how, by understanding the requirements of the organisation, and developing situation-specific roll-out strategies, these barriers to entry can be overcome. The first example is a large organisation who wanted to quickly (within 6 weeks) show management how Shiny could improve information dissemination. As server policies made a proof of concept difficult to run internally, this project used a cloud hosted environment for R, Shiny and a source database. The second example is around two SME's who required access to a validated version of R, which was provided via the Amazon and Azure marketplaces. The key aspect of these projects is the value to IT departments of being able to distribute a pre-configured machine around the organisation.</p>

		      <div class="session-abstract abstract">
			<p>I use the software PHREEQC for modeling rock-water interactions. The output of these geochemical models are several types of complex data tables depending on weather I run thermodynamic mixing, kinetic and reactive transport models. By the increasing number of model runs, automatization of the figure production, easy visualization of output sensitivity on model parameters became necessary, as well as presentation of reactive transport of water in rock by not only figures, but also GIF animations. For these, I use R packages dplyr, reshape2, ggplot2, animation and graphics. I present code, the resulting figures and GIF animations of chemical changes in water while it flows through cells of defined rock, as well as indicated mineral dissolution and precipitation processes in space and time. I also mention R packages PHREEQC and ReacTran to better present the capability of R in the field of geochemistry.</p>

		<h1>Data Visualization Challenge</h1>
	      </div>
	      <p>Our gold sponsor, the BI Consulting team, provides an impressive dataset coming from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office on the flights to and from the Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport between 2007 and 2012 to the interested parties to do exploratory data analysis projects in the means of a data visualization competition.</p>
	      <p>Guidelines for participating in the contest:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Only registered conference attendees can take part in this contest</li>
		<li>You must use R to load, process and visualize the data</li>
		<li>The submission can be a simple plot or a full-blown dashboard using any R-based package as a standalone app, a single image, series of plots, animation or integrated into other projects</li>
		<li>You are willing to release the source code of your analysis with an open-source license</li>
		<li>Prepare a (min) 1-page summary on your submission, eg what is shown (feel free to include plot(s), screenshots) and why it is cool, interesting etc. You can also include links to the source code and to the live visualization if it is available on the web.</li>
		<li>Submissions are to be send to the <a href="mailto:rdataviz@biconsulting.hu">rdataviz@biconsulting.hu</a> e-mail address before Aug 31 2016 midnight CET</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>The submissions will be reviewed by a committee of industry BI experts and R developers, nominated by the BI Consulting team. Their task will be to filter the applications to a reasonable amount of projects to be shown in a live session at the conference, where the attendees will vote for the best submission. The winner(s) of the challenge will receive a certificate, valuable prices (eg <a href="http://budapestbiforum.hu/">Budapest BI Forum</a> conference ticket) and the honour to be the best damn data visualization wizards of the first satRday conference all around the world!</p>
	      <p>You can download the dataset <a href="data/BUD flights 2007-2012 v2.xlsx">here</a> (updated: Aug 20 2016). Yes, it's an Excel file with a space in the file name. If you have any question about the challenge, Bence (<a href="mailto:rdataviz@biconsulting.hu">rdataviz@biconsulting.hu</a>) will be happy to help.</p>
	      <p>Answers to some frequently asked questions:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Rows are monthly aggregates per origin/destination</li>
		<li>Cargo weight is in metric ton</li>
		<li>The "NBR OF PASSENGERS", "CARGO WEIGHT", "NBR OF FLIGHTS" and "SEAT CAPACITY" columns are sum amounts for all flights in the month
</li>
		<li>Based on the above, it's possible that "SEAT CAPACITY" / "NBR OF FLIGHTS" returns a non-integer value, as the number of seats per flight varies</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>May the ETL, modeling and dataviz gods be with you! </p>
