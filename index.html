		  <tr class="abstract"><td colspan="2">
		      <p>There are two data-cleaning related factoids that are quoted often on the web: 80% of the data is unstructured, and about the same fraction of time is spent on data cleaning. Although there is little systematic research to substantiate these claims, most data analysts will agree that getting data 'clean' for analyses is both essential and time-consuming.</p>

		      <p>In this 90 minute tutorial we develop a systematic view on data cleaning. Using the concept of a 'statistical value chain' as starting point, we will see that data cleaning has a natural place in a statistical analyses and that data cleaning can be thought of as a two-step process. In the first step one ensures the correct technical representation of a data set (variable type, text encoding, identifiability of a value, etc.). The second step is about ensuring that data meets expectations from domain knowledge (e.g. ages must be positive, an under-aged person cannot have an income from work, etc.).</p>

		      <p>In this tutorial we will demonstrate, using practical examples, several tools and R packages that can be used to solve both technical and content-related issues. Topics include but are not limited to string processing and approximate text matching, date/time conversion and knowledge-based data validation and correction. We also touch upon how to measure and visualize data quality and the effects of data cleaning on statistics.</p>

		      <p>The focus of this tutorial is scalable machine learning using the H2O R package. H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface.</p>

			<p>Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or ""Super Learners"", from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the h2oEnsemble R package.</p>

			<p>R scripts/notebook with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and made available on GitHub for attendees to follow along on their laptops.</p>

		      <h3>Package overview</h3>

		      <p>The data.table R package provides fast and memory efficient ways for data manipulation together with a flexible and consistent syntax. It was first released to CRAN in 2006. It has had over 30 releases since then with the current latest stable release being v1.9.6. Over 240 CRAN and Bioconductor packages now import/depend on data.table. Its StackOverflow tag has attracted >4000 questions from users in many fields making it a top 3 asked about R package. It is the 8th most starred R package on Github.</p>

															  <h3>Tutorial overview</h3>

															  <p>In this tutorial, we will learn data.table by doing, i.e., by looking at commonly occurring data manipulation questions (based on StackOverflow R tag) and using data.table's syntax and features to solve them. Depending on time availability, we might compare/contrast them to base R / other packages.</p>

															  <p>Briefly, we will look at problems that cover the following features:</p>

															  <ol>
															    <li>Getting data in and out - fread + rbindlist + fwrite.</li>
															    <li>Grouped aggregations and column addition/updates on subsets and joins.</li>

															    <li>Overview of equi-, non-equi, rolling and overlapping interval joins.</li>
															    <li>Reshaping.</li>
															  </ol>

															  <h3>Background knowledge</h3>

															  <p>Familiarity with base R is essential, and with SQL is advantageous but not essential. NOTE: It would be extremely advantageous for the participants to go through the "Introduction to data.table" vignette completely. The link to vignettes is provided at the bottom of this page.</p>
															  <h3>Requirements</h3>
															  <p>R (preferably latest version, for consistency) and latest CRAN version installed.</p>

	      <p>Shiny is a web application framework that makes it easy to build interactive web applications straight from R. A key feature of shiny is that users can create powerful apps driven by R without having to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript. However, incorporating these technologies into your apps can greatly enhance the power of shiny. In this workshop we’ll teach you how to create your own custom JavaScript bindings based on the htmlwidget package. The htmlwidgets package provides a framework for creating such bindings and allows you to bring the best of JavaScript into R. Even though using an htmlwidget is easy, constructing one may be challenging at first as you have to know a number of concepts in order to create a widget. These include things such as how to build an R package and how to use some basic JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This workshop is intended for the intermediate shiny enthusiast with limited experience in HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript, who wants to learn how to extend shiny. We’ll be creating a number of htmlwidgets based on C3.js, a popular JavaScript chart library, based on d3.js. In addition, we show various ways to extend Shiny by using JavaScript outside of the htmlwidgets framework.</>

	      <p>GGplot2 is such a great plotting tool that people consider using R just for the library. In this session we will demonstrate why it is such a great tool for plotting.</p>
	      <p>We will emphasis the joy of working with ggplot by emphasising how visualisations with ggplot have the ability to surprise you. In this session we will start by doing a very basic analysis and we will conclude with the power of having a grammar for visualisation instead of just a mere plotting library. All code will be available afterwards.</p>
	      <p>Visualisations have the power to surprise you during your day to day work. At the end of the session I will give examples of how proper use of ggplot during your analysis makes you a better analyst.</p>

		<h1>Data Visualization Challenge</h1>
	      </div>
	      <p>Our gold sponsor, the BI Consulting team, provides an impressive dataset coming from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office on the flights to and from the Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport between 2007 and 2012 to the interested parties to do exploratory data analysis projects in the means of a data visualization competition.</p>
	      <p>Guidelines for participating in the contest:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Only registered conference attendees can take part in this contest</li>
		<li>You must use R to load, process and visualize the data</li>
		<li>The submission can be a simple plot or a full-blown dashboard using any R-based package as a standalone app, a single image, series of plots, animation or integrated into other projects</li>
		<li>You are willing to release the source code of your analysis with an open-source license</li>
		<li>Prepare a (min) 1-page summary on your submission, eg what is shown (feel free to include plot(s), screenshots) and why it is cool, interesting etc. You can also include links to the source code and to the live visualization if it is available on the web.</li>
		<li>Submissions are to be send to the <a href="mailto:rdataviz@biconsulting.hu">rdataviz@biconsulting.hu</a> e-mail address before Aug 31 2016 midnight CET</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>The submissions will be reviewed by a committee of industry BI experts and R developers, nominated by the BI Consulting team. Their task will be to filter the applications to a reasonable amount of projects to be shown in a live session at the conference, where the attendees will vote for the best submission. The winner(s) of the challenge will receive a certificate, valuable prices (eg <a href="http://budapestbiforum.hu/">Budapest BI Forum</a> conference ticket) and the honour to be the best damn data visualization wizards of the first satRday conference all around the world!</p>
	      <p>You can download the dataset <a href="data/BUD flights 2007-2012 v2.xlsx">here</a> (updated: Aug 20 2016). Yes, it's an Excel file with a space in the file name. If you have any question about the challenge, Bence (<a href="mailto:rdataviz@biconsulting.hu">rdataviz@biconsulting.hu</a>) will be happy to help.</p>
	      <p>Answers to some frequently asked questions:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Rows are monthly aggregates per origin/destination</li>
		<li>Cargo weight is in metric ton</li>
		<li>The "NBR OF PASSENGERS", "CARGO WEIGHT", "NBR OF FLIGHTS" and "SEAT CAPACITY" columns are sum amounts for all flights in the month
</li>
		<li>Based on the above, it's possible that "SEAT CAPACITY" / "NBR OF FLIGHTS" returns a non-integer value, as the number of seats per flight varies</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>May the ETL, modeling and dataviz gods be with you! </p>
